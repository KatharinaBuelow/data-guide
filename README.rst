EURO-CORDEX Data Guide
======================
Guidance for EURO-CORDEX climate projections data use

The Guidance for EURO-CORDEX climate projections data use is intended to provide background information, best practices and links to further information for users of regional climate model data. The main target audiences are researchers in impacts communities, engineers in industry and the public sector, or small and medium enterprises. For each topic, a short summary of the most important aspects is given, followed by references for further and more detailed information. It is important to note that this document represents the current state-of-the-art from the EURO-CORDEX community. However, it is a living document and will be updated as our understanding of regional climate and regional climate change as well as regional climate modelling improves.

In order to provide feedback, please send an email to feedback@euro-cordex.net.
