**General information on the climate system**

General Remarks
---------------
The output of climate simulations are data sets of relevant atmospheric and surface variables. Using these data for various purposes, 
e.g., for analysis of processes, as input for impact models or for estimating projected changes in order to define adaptation pathways,
requires comprehensive analysis and understanding of the data, their validity and representativeness. Some issues are explained in the 
CORDEX terms of use (see also http://www.data.euro-cordex.net), others are described in the Chapter Interpreting regional climate projections.
Helpful advice on how to use climate model output can also be found in :cite:`Kreienkamp2012`, where the 
guidelines ('Leitlinien') are elaborated from a German federal state expert discussion (http://klimawandel.hlug.de/?id=448). 
The discussion paper is available in both German and English.
