**Interpreting regional climate projections**
=============================================

General remarks
---------------

In this section we highlight a few topics that are important to keep in
mind when using climate change projections for practical applications.
It might be necessary that the reader briefly reviews previous sections.

-  Be aware of limitations of climate modelling (see `*What are limits
   of climate modelling?* <#_xvir7l>`__)
-  Understand how climate models work and which processes are
   parameterized (see among others `*What are climate models (global and
   regional)?* <#_sqyw64>`__)
-  Use an ensemble of models (all available relevant models). This
   offers more meaningful results because statistical information can be
   provided. (see among others `*Why are climate ensemble projections
   needed?* <#_3s49zyc>`__)
-  Analyse plausibility and robustness of each climate model and
   scenario (see `*How to identify a “robust expected change” among the
   mass of information?* <#_243i4a2>`__)
-  Analyse at least 30 years and several grid boxes. Be aware that the
   climate signal may be different for different reference periods
   (e.g., 2021-2050 - 1961-1990 vs. 2021-2050 - 1981-2010). Results of
   climate projections for one season or one decade might not be
   meaningful because of the climate variability and their time scale
   (see among others `*What is climate variability?* <#_2jxsxqh>`__).
-  Do not use present day observation data as reference for future
   climate signals (see among others `*How should an ensemble of climate
   projections be used?* <#_2y3w247>`__).
-  Exercise caution when analysing extreme events. Extreme events are
   rare and often require application of special statistical tools to be
   evaluated properly. Collaboration with experts in statistics is
   strongly advised (see among others `*What are limits of climate
   modelling?* <#_xvir7l>`__).

How to interpret small-scale structures?
----------------------------------------

There is still a debate to what extent small-scale structures at the
spatial scale of individual climate model grid cells can and should be
interpreted (e.g. Grasso 2000). On the one hand, several grid cells
(typically more than four) are required to resolve atmospheric
structures. Smaller scale variations are partly removed by the numerical
filters of climate models in order to ensure numerical stability.
Spatial smoothing is also frequently applied to the surface forcing
fields of a climate model, in particular to orography in order to avoid
steep topographic gradients and corresponding numerical instabilities.
On the other hand, the surface forcing is grid cell specific and
directly influences the simulation results over the individual grid
cells. This is true for forcings such as topography, land use and soil
type. Neighbouring grid cells, for instance, are typically located at
different elevations which directly leads to differences in near-surface
air temperature and to differences in the presence or absence of
cryospheric features at the grid cell scale.

The most appropriate manner to analyse small-scale structures probably
lies somewhere in-between the above described cases - i.e.,
interpretation of simulated atmospheric features at the grid cell scale
should be avoided unless a direct and consistent influence of specific
surface forcings can be expected.

How to interpret divergence between models?

Climate models differ in their model details as well as in the
respective model setup (see chapter `*What are limits of climate
modelling?* <#_xvir7l>`__). This explains differences in the output of
different models even if the initialisation or the lateral boundary
conditions of the model are the same. Further, differences in the
results of regional models can be attributed to different
regionalisation methods (e.g. dynamical vs. statistical downscaling).

It has to be noted that there is *a priori* no criteria for which chain
of global to regional model is the *best*\  one. Therefore, the first
recommendation is to treat all model combinations as equal. Only after
an in-depth evaluation of all regional model results (see chapter `*How
can climate model simulations be evaluated?* <#_319y80a>`__) there may
be clear indications to sort out particular models. This must be done
consistently for all ensemble analyses.

How to interpret time and space variability?
--------------------------------------------

Individual components of the climate system (including their
interactions and feedbacks) operate on very different time scales.
Variability of the climate system is observed at time scales ranging
from intra-seasonal to inter-decadal (or even centennial and millennial)
scale. Furthermore, local physical processes may induce large spatial
variability of the climate characteristics, that typically appear more
robustly over complex surfaces, e.g., mountainous or coastal regions.

The climate system is vastly complex, there is a number of governing
processes that we have deficient knowledge about (e.g., turbulence,
cloud microphysics, surface fluxes, aerosols). Due to this fact and the
limited computational capacity, a certain level of simplification in
climate models is inevitable. It means that climate models are able to
provide information about climate variability only on limited spatial
and time scale, depending on their resolution, described physical
processes, and on their domain-size in case of regional simulations.

Global climate models currently have 100-500 km horizontal resolution.
These models are dedicated to project the future climate change and its
variability on larger time and spatial scale (e.g., large scale
atmospheric or ocean internal modes of variability like NAO and ENSO,
respectively). Due to such long-memory phenomena existing in the
atmosphere and ocean, to distinguish climate change from climate
variability, statistics of the meteorological conditions should be
considered over at least a 30-year long period. Local processes may
significantly alter the general large scale signals, as a result changes
on smaller scale may be amplified or lessened, or even be in contrast
with the global tendencies.

Detailed information about climate change and its variability for a
smaller area (e.g., a country) can be obtained from regional climate
models, which are applying 10-50 km resolution nowadays and are
therefore describing dynamical processes in the atmosphere in more
detail. However, it must be considered that the effective model
resolution is at least 2-3 times coarser than the grid spacing, i.e.,
only phenomena with a characteristic size bigger than this effective
resolution should be examined. Intra-annual or intra-seasonal
variability, with special emphasis on climate extremes can be adequately
estimated with the use of fine resolution regional climate models.
However, it should be taken into account that going towards finer time
and spatial scale of specific investigations, the model results tend to
become noisy. Consequently, the ensemble approach for evaluation of the
climate models is especially important as much as it is important to
have the ensemble approach for projections about future climate
characteristics.

In climate projections, main sources of uncertainties are (i) the
internal variability, (ii) the scenario uncertainty and (iii) the model
uncertainty. Based on Hawkins and Sutton (2009, 2011), it is concluded
that model uncertainty is of great importance both for temperature and
precipitation projections at all time scales. The choice of emission
scenarios is relevant rather in temperature projections and on
multi-decadal time scales. In precipitation projections, total
uncertainty is basically composed of the internal variability and model
uncertainty, especially when focusing on smaller regions.

How to interpret and adjust model biases?
-----------------------------------------

There is a growing demand for regional climate change information for
use in impact modelling, which in turn provides downstream inputs for
decision-making. Such information generated by climate models has a
number of uncertainties and these affect the ability of climate models
to accurately simulate changes in the complex climate system. All models
are only an approximation of the real climate system and have different
simplifications resulting in biases of the simulated climate when
compared to the observed one. It has been widely recognised that raw
climate model output cannot always be used directly as input to, e.g.,
impact models. As a result an adjustment (also referred to as “bias
correction”) towards the observed climatology is necessary.
Alternatively, one may use results from ESD, which are calibrated
against observations, provided its assumptions are justified and
observation density is sufficient.

Nowadays, bias adjustment has become an integral part of the
pre-processing of climate simulations for the use in impact modelling
studies. However, bias adjustment is generally a statistical approach
missing physical arguments, and applying bias adjustment to climate
model simulations introduces a new often unexplored level of
uncertainty. Moreover, often bias-adjusted simulations are ‘blindly’
used, even though their limitations are very well documented. In short,
bias adjustment should be considered only as a statistical
post-processing approach, while the reduction of model biases can only
be done by continuous model development.

The two main questions regarding bias adjustment are: i) What in general
can be bias adjusted and what not and ii) How can bias adjustment modify
future climate projections? Most bias adjustment methods are based on
the quantile mapping approach (e.g., Piani et. al. 2010) which generally
provides very good results in terms of seasonal means and percentiles
but does not take directly into account time-dependent statistics as for
example consecutive dry/wet days (Addor and Seibert, 2014). Additionally
it has to be noted that such a point wise approach is not supposed to
correct spatial displacements of atmospheric phenomena such as the
positioning of the simulated rain belt associated with the Inter
Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

With respect to the second question it was also found that bias-adjusted
climate simulations alter the projected climate change signals when
compared to non-adjusted ones (Maurer and Pierce, 2014). A number of
different approaches (modifications) are used to deal with this issue as
for example the ISI-MIP method, which tries to preserve monthly mean
trends (Hempel et al. 2013). However, future climate change can be
expected to not only affect monthly means but also the different
higher-order statistics (trends in extremes etc.).

Despite these very well known problems and fragmented recommendations,
there are no systematic assessments of bias-adjustment-related
uncertainties and no general guidance on the use of bias-adjusted
climate simulations.

Bias-adjusted CORDEX simulations should be used carefully with full
understanding of all potential limitations of the bias adjustment
approach. It’s strongly recommended to read following report describing

How can climate change results be communicated?
-----------------------------------------------

Climate change results are in most cases communicated to persons who are
not familiar with climate modelling. Therefore, it is necessary not only
to deliver the results but explain what the results are based on and
what the processing methods are. All results - text, tables, figures -
must contain the full information. The necessary points are listed
below.

-  Always give the full result information (scenario, global and
   regional models, time slice, region, spatial resolution...), in the
   case of climate change information the reference and the future
   period must be given. The user should be able to reproduce the steps
   taken based on the methods and data description.
-  Always communicate climate change result *and*\  uncertainty range
-  Differentiate scenarios - e.g. in case of low radiative forcing
   scenario point out that this can be used to highlight mitigation
   effects.
-  Make clear that the result is not a forecast but a projection.
-  Statements concerning trends, robustness and exceeding probability
   must be based on state-of-the-art analysis and statistical methods.
-  Climate change signals can be communicated as absolute differences or
   as relative differences. It depends on the meteorological parameter
   which value is suitable, e.g. relative changes are not sensible for
   temperature. For parameters like precipitation or wind speed it may
   depend on the context whether the climate changes is communicated as
   absolute or relative value, e.g. for low-wind regions an increase of
   10 % in wind speed still may be a negligible change.
-  Interpretation of climate change results must take into account the
   information in the chapters above, particularly limits of modelling,
   suitability of the used data in time and space scales, bandwidth or
   probability statements.
-  Visualisation of results is an essential tool in communication,
   therefore the figures must be clear and not suggest wrong
   conclusions. Helpful hints are given in Kreienkamp et al., 2012. Some
   examples of visualisation of ensemble results are documented in
   Hennemuth et al., 2013, based on "How to read a climate-fact-sheet"
