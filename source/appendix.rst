Further details on RCP and SRES scenarios:

-  **SRES**\  (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios; Nakicenovic et
   al., 2000) scenarios quantify anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
   gases (and some other pollutants), land-use and other factors for the
   21st century by giving a wide range of possible alternatives, based
   on modelling (socio-economical, bio-geochemical modelling) and
   research. The scenarios are grouped in 4 major families: A1, A2, B1,
   B2, each consisting of several scenarios. The A families are
   characterized by rapid economic development, while B scenarios
   represent environmental sustainability. A1 and B1 versions show
   population decrease after few decades and global solutions for the
   world challenges, whereas A2 and B2 scenarios indicate continuous
   population growth with local socio-economic solutions. A1 scenario
   have three groups describing alternative directions of technological
   change in the energy system: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil
   energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B). By the
   end of the 21st century, the highest concentration levels are reached
   in A1FI and A2; more “optimistic” future paths are resulted by B1 and
   A1T; and A1B is a medium scenario.
-  **RCP** (Representative Concentration Pathways; Moss et al., 2008)
   scenarios are the most recent, developed for the last IPCC Assessment
   Report (AR5) using integrated assessment modelling, climate modelling
   and impact modelling. The basic concept of RCP is different from the
   SRES: instead of socio-economic scenarios, these scenarios define
   pathways of the additional radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic
   activity till the end of the 21st century (the value in 1750 is
   considered as reference). The reason behind the conceptual change is
   the fact that a single radiative forcing pathway can result from a
   range of socio-economic and technological development scenarios. Four
   basic sets of scenarios were created, named after their total
   radiative forcing (in W/m²) in year 2100 relative to 1750: RCP8.5,
   RCP6.0, RCP4.5 and RCP2.6. RCP 8.5 represents very high greenhouse
   gas emission leading to 8.5 W/m² radiative forcing, which continues
   to rise even after 2100; RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are stabilization
   scenarios, meaning that the forcings stabilize at their given value
   around the end of the century; and RCP2.6 represents an aggressive
   mitigation scenario with a considerable negative future emission.
   According to the AR5 report, global surface temperature change by the
   end of the 21st century is likely to remain below 2°C, relative to
   the 1850-1900 period (i.e., the important 2°C target can be kept),
   for RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, but it is likely to exceed this threshold for
   RCP6.0 and RCP8.5.
