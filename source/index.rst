EURO-CORDEX Data Guidelines
===========================

Guidance for EURO-CORDEX climate projections data use. 

The Guidance for EURO-CORDEX climate projections data use is intended to provide  background information, 
best practices and links to further information for users of  regional climate model data. The main target
audiences are researchers in impacts communities, engineers in industry and the public sector, or small 
and medium enterprises. For each topic, a short summary of the most important aspects is given, followed 
by references for further and more detailed information. It is important to note that this document represents 
the current state-of-the-art from the EURO-CORDEX community. However, it is a living document and will be 
updated as our understanding of regional climate and regional climate change as well as regional climate modelling improves. 

In order to provide feedback, please send an email to feedback@euro-cordex.net.
